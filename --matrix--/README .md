Control can sometimes be an illusion, but sometimes you need illusion to gain control.
Fantasy is an easy way to give meaning to the world, to cloak our harsh reality in escapist comfort.
After all, isn't that why we surround ourselves with so many screens?
So we can avoid seeing?
So we can avoid each other?
So we can avoid truth.
